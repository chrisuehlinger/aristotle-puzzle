Aristotle's Puzzle
==================

This is a toy AI I built to solve a simple number puzzle. You can find [a description of the project](http://chrisuehlinger.com/aristotle-puzzle) on my website.

Installation
------------

Perform an `npm install` to pull down all the dependencies, then use `npm start` to spin up the development server and surf on over to http://localhost:3000 to check it out.

Make sure you do any tinkering on the `master` branch. The `gh-pages` branch uses a different version of the webpack bundle and doesn't perform live reloading.
